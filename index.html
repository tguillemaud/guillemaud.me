        <h2>Digital transformation – IT – Entrepreneurship</h2>
        <p>I am a digital and IT native and an enthusiastic entrepreneur who firmly believes in mixing a fast-growing business with strong ethics. I'm a leader by example and I constantly seek to inspire my team, without hesitating to roll up my sleeves and work hard to deliver my best.</p>
        <p>Being a tech-savvy and design enthusiast, I have a broad scope of skills and knowledge when it comes to the digital age and IT industry. I work by combining the appropriate technical solutions and finding creative ways for products to thrive in the digital age.</p>
        <p>Originally from France, I hold a double Master's Degree in Entrepreneurship and Digital Business. Right after graduation, I co-founded <a href="https://www.it-consultis.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="IT Consultis">IT Consultis</a>. Since then, I have been able to acquire extensive knowledge of various technologies, including Magento, Laravel, Drupal, WordPress, and performance-oriented web development, with a focus on Asia's dynamic digital landscape.</p>
        <p>As of April 2023, I have taken on the role of <strong>IT Director</strong> at <a href="https://maisonrmi.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Maison Retail Management International">Maison Retail Management International</a> in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Maison, launched in 2002, quickly became one of the largest fashion distributors in Vietnam and Cambodia. Maison has a strong history of introducing international fashion brands to the region. With 160+ stores across Vietnam and Cambodia, Maison offers a diverse and accessible retail experience for fashion enthusiasts in the region.</p>
        <p>In my role as IT Director, I lead a team of 30, covering <strong>Infrastructure & Security, Applications, SAP, Digital customer touch-points, and Support</strong>.</p>
        <p>My work, as well as my thoughts, have been featured in multiple publications such as The Times and Le Figaro.</p>
